# Food Choices Streamlit App

This project is a Streamlit app that analyzes the food choices and preferences of college students based on the "Food choices and preferences of college students" dataset.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Food choices and preferences of college students" dataset, obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borapajo/food-choices). This dataset includes information on food choices, nutrition, preferences, childhood favorites, and other information from college students. There are 126 responses from students. Data is raw and uncleaned. Cleaning is in the process and as soon as that is done, additional versions of the data will be posted.
